                <p>
                  &emsp; Having MED 181 online the past 2 years has impacted our training process and forced many 
                  of our volunteers to learn their roles during (shadowing) shifts. Training is also fragmented into 
                  specific positions that can leave volunteers with an incomplete picture of clinic, a lack of 
                  experienced volunteers to seek guidance from, and lead to misunderstandings between different roles.

                <p>
                  &emsp; Having so many different roles can also overwhelm our patients and lead to a diffusion 
                  of responsibility of each patientâ€™s care. As the patient moves throughout clinic, 
                  there are many handoffs where key patient information needs to be communicated in a 
                  very short window of time. These transfers often lead to delays and mistakes that affect 
                  both the patient and volunteer experience.

                <p>
                  &emsp; Differences in roles also forces some volunteers to do extra work after clinic is over, 
                  while other volunteers are needed as soon as they arrive. Some volunteers want to take on more tasks 
                  and be more closely involved in patient care while others just want more time to interact with their 
                  patients. Our changes below seek to create an equitable distribution of clinic responsibilities 
                  and opportunities.

              &emsp; Our new clinic workflow centers around the <strong>Patient Navigator</strong> training, 
              which <u>all volunteers will receive</u>. After 3 quarters in the Patient Navigator role, volunteers 
              are eligible to become <strong>Referrals Chairs</strong>, <strong>Front Desk Managers</strong>, 
              or <strong>Preclinical Volunteers</strong>.
